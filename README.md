[![TanStarter Lite preview](./public/og.png)](https://github.com/MkFastHQ/mkfast-lite)

TanStarter Lite is the lightweight, open-source edition of
[TanStarter](https://tanstarter.dev): a deliberately small starter for a
multilingual public website. It includes a complete localized landing page,
light/dark/system themes, SEO endpoints, tests, and Cloudflare Workers
deployment—without the operational surface of a SaaS starter.

It intentionally does not include authentication, payments, persistence,
storage, cache, transactional email, newsletters, or an admin surface. Add
those only when they match the product you are building.

## Features

- **Multilingual by default** — English at `/` and Simplified Chinese at `/zh`,
  with typed Paraglide messages and a language menu that keeps the current
  section anchor.
- **A focused landing page** — responsive navigation, hero, stack,
  architecture, template, FAQ, and closing sections.
- **Theme choices** — light, dark, and system themes; the selection persists
  in local storage.
- **Search-ready public surface** — localized canonical and alternate links,
  Open Graph and Twitter metadata, JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and
  `manifest.webmanifest`.
- **No required services** — the default Worker has no D1, R2, KV, or secret
  bindings and deploys to `workers.dev`.

## Tech stack

- [React 19](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) and TanStack Router
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) for
  type-safe localization
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and
  [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.30.3 or later

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MkFastHQ/mkfast-lite.git
cd mkfast-lite
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` for English or `http://localhost:3000/zh` for
Simplified Chinese.

### Common commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vite development server on `127.0.0.1:3000` |
| `pnpm check` | Run Biome checks, locale parity checks, unit tests, and TypeScript |
| `pnpm test` | Run the Vitest unit suite |
| `pnpm build` | Create a production build and type-check it |
| `pnpm e2e` | Run Playwright desktop and mobile coverage |
| `pnpm locale:compile` | Regenerate the Paraglide runtime after locale edits |
| `pnpm locale:check` | Check English and Chinese message-key parity |
| `pnpm cf-typegen` | Regenerate Worker environment types after Wrangler changes |
| `pnpm deploy` | Build and deploy the Worker |

`pnpm e2e` covers both locales, language switching, theme persistence,
responsive navigation, FAQ behavior, machine-readable SEO endpoints, and the
intentionally absent application routes.

## Customize the template

1. Update the site name, canonical URL, repository URL, default theme, and
   navigation in `src/config/website.ts`.
2. Edit English and Simplified Chinese copy in
   `project.inlang/messages/en.json` and `project.inlang/messages/zh.json`.
3. Replace `public/favicon.svg` and the Open Graph image in `public/`.
4. Reorder or remove homepage sections in
   `src/components/home/home-page.tsx`; adjust visual tokens in
   `src/styles.css` when needed.
5. Add routes under `src/routes/` with TanStack Router's file-route
   convention. Add matching English and `/zh` routes, localized metadata, and
   messages when a page needs localized content.

Locale JSON files are the source of truth. Never edit
`src/locale/paraglide/` by hand; regenerate it after changing copy:

```bash
pnpm locale:compile
pnpm locale:check
```

Do not edit generated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` or `worker-configuration.d.ts`
by hand either; regenerate them with the relevant tooling. Set
`websiteConfig.url` to the production origin before launch. Until then, the
SEO metadata uses the incoming request origin, keeping local development and
deployment previews valid.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Authenticate Wrangler once, then deploy:

```bash
pnpm exec wrangler login
pnpm deploy
```

The committed `wrangler.jsonc` keeps `workers_dev` enabled and contains no
account ID, custom domain, resource bindings, or application secrets. The
first deployment publishes to your Cloudflare account's `workers.dev`
subdomain.

To attach a hostname without making it the template default:

```bash
pnpm exec wrangler deploy --domain your-site.example.com
```

Do not commit personal account IDs, tokens, or secrets to a project created
from this template.

## Architecture

- `src/routes/` — the English and Chinese home pages, 404 handling, and
  machine-readable endpoints.
- `src/components/` — layout, language/theme controls, UI primitives, and
  landing-page sections.
- `src/config/` — product-owned site identity, repository link, and
  navigation.
- `src/lib/` — locale routing, SEO, and utility contracts.
- `src/styles.css` — shared theme tokens and global styles.
- `project.inlang/messages/` — authoritative English and Simplified Chinese
  copy.
- `scripts/` — locale validation.
- `tests/` — Vitest unit contracts and Playwright acceptance tests.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — the Workers entry point and committed deployment default.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, make a focused change, update
tests and documentation when behavior changes, and run the relevant checks
before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm build
pnpm e2e
git diff --check
```
